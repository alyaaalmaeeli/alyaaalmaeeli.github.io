   <article><h6 style="display:none">section</h6><p>( London ) the heart of the united kingdom and one of my favorite cities I have always dreamt to visit Since I was young. I visited London in August 2014 with my family, we explore lot of places in London. Hyde Park one of the royal and largest parks in London And it has been classified as one of the greatest city parks in the world. There is a lot of activities to do in Hyde Park, people enjoy picnicking which it’s a great way outdoor in the Hyde Park, Breathing fresh air and enjoying a great nature view with friends or family member. People also stay active in Hyde park by cycling, playing football , jogging and a lot of sport.</p></article>
